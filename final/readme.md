## Subaru Sanbar Greek Mythology Final Project

### Project Summary

Our project is a website that documents Greek Mythology, which is one of the largest areas of historical mythology. We chose this topic because it is very broad and allowed us to easily create many pages.

### Key Takeaways

Some of the skills that are essential for this project include DOM manipulation, event handling, API calls, and property access (dot notation). These skills allow us to work with a database and render specific data associated with our theme of choice, in our case Greek mythology. Finally, event handling allows for users of our application to interact with the various elements.
