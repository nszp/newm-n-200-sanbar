## Subaru Sanbar Greek Mythology Final Project

### Project Summary

Our project is a website that documents Greek Mythology, which is one of the largest areas of historical mythology. We chose this topic because it is very broad and allowed us to easily create many pages.

### Key Takeaways

Some of the skills that are essential for this project include DOM manipulation, event handling, API calls, and property access (dot notation). These skills allow us to work with a database and render specific data associated with our theme of choice, in our case Greek mythology. Finally, event handling allows for users of our application to interact with the various elements.

### Core Webpages

List core webpages and briefly describe the page of them

### Design Choices & Local Storage Design

Since our website is centered around Greek mythology, we took heavy inspiration from the design style from that time period. A website that gave us inspiration would be [GreekMythology.com](https://www.greekmythology.com/). This website features stylistic choices that make the website feel like it would fit in the Greek Mythology time period.

The color palette for our website consists of brown colors with a light blue accent color, which follow the color palette for Greek Mythology

**Colors:**

- `#77B5BF` - _Light blue accent color_

- `#534132` - _Dark Brown for text color_

- `#C0BAA8` - _Tan color with paper texture for the background_

We also plan to use the fonts _**Disalina Regular**_ and _**LTC Italian Old Style Pro Regular**_, as those fonts evoke the Greek Mythology style.

**Local Storage**

The local storage data structure will feature user login data, with data such as
`{username: “ZeusTheLeader”, password: “lightning123” }` Users will be able to create their accounts by typing in a username and password, which will be uploaded to local storage. This will allow for multiple users to create accounts. We also plan to allow the user to create new entries on the list pages, so the data structure design for this will need to mirror the API’s structure.
